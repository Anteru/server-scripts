This is a collection of server scripts I use on my servers. Currently, these are:

* [ZFS snapshots & backup](zfs.md): Create snapshots of ZFS file systems and create back-ups.
* [VM backup](backup-vm.md): Backup VMs using KVM
* [Delete e-Mails](delete-old-emails.md): Delete (and optionally backup) old emails on an IMAP server.
